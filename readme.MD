# HYPERGEN - Synthetic Aadhaar ID Card Generation for Forgery and Quality Issues

HYPERGEN is a powerful tool designed to generate synthetic Aadhaar cards with configurable details (name, DOB, Aadhar number, VID), simulate forgery scenarios (text replacement, blurring, field occlusion), and evaluate OCR robustness. It integrates computer vision, OCR, and Blender-based 3D occlusion rendering for realistic dataset generation and quality testing.



## 🔧 Features

- **Aadhaar Card Generation**:
  - Generate synthetic Aadhaar cards from user-provided prompts using OpenCV or AI-based rendering.
  - Replace fields like **Name**, **DOB**, **Aadhar Number**, and **VID** using  EasyOCR for layout alignment.

-  **Existing ID Processing**:
  - Upload existing Aadhaar card images.
  - Redact either the name or Aadhar number.
  - Optionally apply a blur effect to simulate privacy preservation.

- **3D Occlusion Simulation (Forgery Tool)**:
  - Overlay 3D objects like **coin**, **pen**, or **pencil** over specific fields using Blender.
  - Automatically detects bounding boxes for fields (name, DOB, Aadhar) via OCR and maps real-world coordinates to Blender's 3D space.

- **Inpainting UI**:
  - Fill in redacted/occluded regions for synthetic forgery detection training using inpainting models (Flux-based).

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

**Dependencies include**:

* `opencv-python`
* `pytesseract`
* `Pillow`
* `numpy`
* `easyocr`
* `gradio`
* `blender` (installed separately and added to PATH for occlusion)

### 2. Set up Blender Paths

Make sure Blender is installed and paths in `app.py` (line 610+) are updated:

```python
blender_executable = "D:/Blender/blender.exe"
occlusion_script = "C:/.../occlude_render.py"
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

This will launch a **Gradio web UI** with the following tabs:

* Aadhaar Generator (with redaction & occlusion options)
* Aadhar Inpainting



## 💡Example Prompts

* `Create Aadhar card with name Rohan Singh and DOB 15/08/1995 and Aadhar number 1234 5678 9123`
* `Generate an Aadhaar with name Priya, born on 01.01.2000, Aadhar number 9876 5432 1001 and VID 1234 5678 9123 4567`



## ⚙️ Occlusion Settings

You can simulate forgery or quality degradation by placing 3D objects over specific Aadhaar fields.

* Supported objects:

  * `coin`
  * `pen`
  * `pencil`

* Supported fields:

  * `name`
  * `aadhar_number`
  * `dob`

Example:

```bash
# Run occlusion from CLI
blender --background --python src/occlude_render.py -- \
    --img_path template.png \
    --object_type coin \
    --field aadhar_number \
    --render_path output.png \
    ...
```



## 📦 Output

All generated or processed images are stored in a temporary `/temp` directory automatically created by the script.
